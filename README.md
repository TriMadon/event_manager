# Event Manager

A simple exercise in manipulating data using Ruby's libraries. it includes a sample data file about conference attendees, and that data is used to send costumized letters to each of them with info about their representatives. the data is also cleaned (zipcodes and phone  numbers) and aggregated to discover which hours of the day and which days of the week had the largest amount of registrations.
